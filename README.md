# Enabling-a-Variable-Output-Regulator-to-Produce-0-volts?-Caveat-Designer!

This is a spreadsheet for calculating a set of resistor values for the Figure 2 circuit in 
https://www.edn.com/Enabling-a-Variable-Output-Regulator-to-Produce-0-volts-Caveat-Designer 
These resistors place a limit on the circuit's minimum output voltage, taking the tolerances of 
the resistors, the regulator's reference voltage, and the separate reference voltage V_ext into account.
