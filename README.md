# Enabling-a-Variable-Output-Regulator-to-Produce-0-volts?-Caveat-Designer!

This is a spreadsheet for calculating a set of resistor values for the Figure 2 circuit in 
https://www.edn.com/Enabling-a-Variable-Output-Regulator-to-Produce-0-volts?-Caveat-Designer! 
These resistors place a minimum limit on the circuit's output voltage taking the tolerances of 
the resistors and the regulator's reference voltage and separate regulator voltage into account.
